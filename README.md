# Examples of Complete POPxf Files
This repository contains complete examples of JSON files in the POPxf format.

## Single polynomial mode

## Function-of-polynomials mode

- `Wlnu.json` containing three ratios of partial $W$-boson widths to different lepton generations, computed using `flavio`.

## Correlated uncertainties

- `B0mumu.json` and `Bsmumu.json` containing the branching ratios of the rare decays $B^0 \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$, and `corr.json` containing their correlated parameter-dependent uncertainties, computed using `flavio`.
